Bank Loan Report Dashboard 1: An Overview
To successfully monitor our bank's lending activity and performance, we need a detailed Bank Loan Report. This report will provide insights into important loan-related variables over time, allowing for data-driven decision-making and strategy development. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. Furthermore, identifying 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on certain criteria is critical for assessing lending success. A loan status-categorized grid display provides a brief overview of important metrics linked with various loan situations.


Dashboard 2: Visual representation
Visual display of key loan parameters and trends is essential for making informed choices. Monthly trends shown by line charts will show differences in total loan applications, funded amounts, and amounts received over time. A complete map will show regional loan analysis by state, assisting in the identification of regions of high activity . Donut charts will provide loan data based on different terms, while bar charts will show lending metrics distribution across borrowers with different employment periods and loan purposes. 


Dashboard 3: Detailed Insights
The Details Dashboard aims to provide a consolidated view of essential loan data, offering users easy access to critical information.
